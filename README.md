# Faceinsight Sandbox

It is the main repository that serves as a centralized development environment for all (frontend, backend and database) components, allowing us to work on them together while keeping them as separate Git repositories. 

# Why Sandbox

It provides a way to manage the dependencies between the two components, track their versions, and facilitate collaboration among developers working on different parts of the system. 


# How to setup Sandbox

This repository contains source code for E Basket Case. Refer [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed information on having a deployment of your own.
